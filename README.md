# PokemonTCGApp

A single line app that showcases the first set of Pokemon cards made. Many improvements could be made to this project but this is a good start.

## Reasoning
This app was created for people to remember how it felt to collect Pokemon cards when they were younger. 
I wanted to replicate the feeling of having all your cards in a binder and being able to take them out to look at them.
